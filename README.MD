# Choco

### Why it is archived

I archived this for a few reasons:
- The name "choco" is already taken by chocolatey
- Rust is not the best language to do this in
- I don't love the GPL license

I have made something similar using a batch script, which I have published under [MPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/), in a repository named [coco](https://github.com/liambloom/coco).
